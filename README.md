# Little_Project_Arqt_Sistm
Mini Project for the Systems Architecture course

# Objective

The focus of this mini-project is to develop an application that interacts with a pre-provided microservice, which provides data on students enrolled in the social services course. Through this application, students will be able to perform simple tasks related to academic life.
The application, of a hybrid and monolithic nature, will consume data from the microservice without the need to modify it, considering the project's time constraints.
During development, students should adopt design patterns such as MVC, as well as adhere to SOLID, GRASP, and Gang of Four (GoF) design principles to ensure clean and well-structured code.
